# Thermo-hydromechanical Numerical Simulation
This repository contains 3D thermo-poroelastoplastic numerical simulations solved with open source software Fenicsx. The goal of this repository is to supply freely available numerical codes for coupled geomechanics-fluid flow-temperature applications, e.g., geothermal energy, carbon geological storage, hydrocarbon recovery, etc.

The following open-source packages must be installed prior to running the code:
1) Fenicsx - https://fenicsproject.org/
2) Dolfiny - https://github.com/michalhabera/dolfiny
3) This Github repo (pip install)
3) Gmsh - https://gmsh.info/

Downlownd the material property file (.yml extension) and put in the working python directory.
Lastly, the preferred results visualization tool is Paraview - https://www.paraview.org/
